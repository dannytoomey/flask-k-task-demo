This is a to-do list

MAJOR
-- Figure out how to store and read data securely
    |-- idea: store as JSON files on a route accessed by keystroke that doesn't actually change the page, 
    |   just gets and posts to an unseen page
    |-- check how prolific stores data. maybe there somthing there?

MINOR
- Change the buttons to just F, J, and space 
- Add practice that shows how to do the experiment
- Add a "press space" function that will pause the experiment until the particant is ready to continue
